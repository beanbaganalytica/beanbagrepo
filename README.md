<summary><h4>4.Streaming to Discord on Windows </h4></summary>

As long as Kodi is downloaded from the Microsoft Store you may add it by doing the following:
   
"Note: If the game does not appear, try manually adding your game by going to **User Settings > Game Activity > Add it!**

Unfortunately, if your game is not recognized by Game Detection, or through the process of manually adding it, then you will not be able to stream the game."
